random pattern, but have been build for an ideal defense 
and are connected by tall, thick walls made of brown stone.
Tall windows are scattered thinly across the walls in an 
asymmetric pattern, along with same-sized holes for 
archers and artillery. A moderate gate with broad metal 
doors, a draw bridge and archer holes guards the only 
entrance to the castle build at the edges of a shoreline 
and it's the only easy way in, but easy is very relative

squared barrier around this marvelous castle and are 
connected by lower, thick walls made of brown stone.
Stylish windows are scattered thinly around the walls in 
fairly symmetrical patterns, along with symmetric holes for 
archers and artillery. A great gate with huge metal doors, 
a regular bridge and a moat guards the inhabitants of this 
island castle and it's the only way in, if you can make it 
that is. Huge dragon bones litter the fields outside the 
castle, half overgrown, but still a painful reminder of the 
past. This castle is relatively new, but so far it stood its 
ground with ease and it'll likely do so for ages to come.

barrier around this marvelous castle and are connected by 
high, solid walls made of bronze stone. Small windows are 
scattered generously across the walls in an asymmetric 
pattern, along with symmetric holes for archers and 
artillery. A sizable gate with tall wooden doors and hot oil 
pots guards the only passage into the castle build upon a 
mountain top, but it's not the only way in, but it'll be your 
best shot if you wish to conquer this castle. A handful of 
waterfalls flow into various small rivers and provide the 
precious farm fields outside the castle with needed water. 
This castle looks very new, but without knowing its 
history it's impossible to tell if it's a newly build castle or 
a well kept one.</div>  <img src="img/Arrow-logoc.png" alt="" class="btn_arrow3"></div>

                    <div class="text_personaj">If someone asks us to show “angry and brutal” simply through a character design, we 
tend to think about a big character and how they execute this brutality. They crush skulls 
with their bare hands. They wield a hammer or achainsaw. They have big jaws and 
sharp teeth. To show that they are exclusively using their bare fists to fight, it’s a good 
idea to give them muscles, and make them big or tall. A well-trained body means the 
character is strong and has the realistic capacity to intimidate just standing in front of 
us even without wielding weapons at all. Which is why big monsters or beasts are usually 
boss fights in video games. The sample below is a “gentle, but scary when angry, treant 
that likes taking care of nature and plants, but get in the way and it will stomp you”-
